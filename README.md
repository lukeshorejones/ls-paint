# LS Paint
A paint program written in Python with TkInter and PIL. Available tools are the brush, eraser, line and rectangle. You can change the size and shape of the brush and eraser, open images, and save your creations.

This is one of my earliest programming projects, which I have recently revisited and improved significantly code-wise. The name LS Paint is a pun involving MS Paint and... my name.

# User Guide
This program requires Python 3, TkInter and PIL to be installed. You can install the dependencies with ``pip install tkinter`` and ``pip install pillow``.

# v1.0 Changelog
 - Added main.py, classes.py and the assets folder!

# What Did I Learn?
 - How to use TkInter (when I first worked on this project years ago).
 - How to use classes in Python (again, when I first worked on this project).
 - How to use PIL and combine it with TkInter for image saving.
